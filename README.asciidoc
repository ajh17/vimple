_Pacifying Vimmers_

http://of-vim-and-vigor.blogspot.com/2012/03/pacifying-vimmers.html[Ad]

Vimple provides VimLOO (Object Oriented VimL) objects for Vim's
write-only ++:ex++ commands, such as ++:ls++, ++:scriptnames++ and
++:highlight++.

Vimple provides existing objects for these builtin ++:ex++ commands,
and allows Vim developers to craft their own objects for others.
